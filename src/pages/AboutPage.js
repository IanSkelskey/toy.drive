                        Hello and welcome! I'm Ian Skelskey, a shift supervisor
                        and barista trainer at Bristol Plaza Starbucks, an
                        educational assistant at Tunxis Community College and a

                        <h3>Our Journey</h3>
                        This journey began in 2019 as a heartwarming partnership
                        between Starbucks and Connecticut Children's Medical
                        Center. What started with a humble collection of around
                        50 toys has blossomed into something truly remarkable.
                        In our most recent drive in 2021, we collected nearly
                        200 toys! Not only that, but we also began fundraising,
                        setting up an official give page through the hospital
                        and raising a few hundred dollars to further support the
                        cause.

                <h3>Expanding Our Horizons</h3>
                <p>
                    This year, we faced a new challenge: a lack of corporate
                    marketing support. But that didn't slow us down. Instead, it
                    sparked creativity in our approach. I took the initiative to
                    design this website to organize all relevant information and
                    help expand our efforts. Our goal is to keep the spirit of
                    giving alive, not just through this website but also by
                    maintaining our{' '}
